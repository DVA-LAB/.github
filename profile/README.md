## Hi there 👋
Welcome to DVA LAB (Drone Video Analysis) – part of the Tech for Impact LAB AI track! We're working on an exciting and impactful project aimed at preserving the habitat of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins around Jeju Island by leveraging AI technology to analyze drone footage.

## 🌍 Our Mission
Our mission is to develop a web service that analyzes drone videos to detect illegal activities, track dolphins, and monitor anomalies, helping to protect these intelligent marine creatures.

## 🚀 Project Goals
Develop a drone video analysis web service using AI.
Enhance the AI models for detecting, tracking, and anomaly detection through rigorous training and optimization.
Collaborate with a passionate team dedicated to making a real-world impact in marine conservation.

## 👥 Who We Are
We are a team of engineers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who are driven by the vision of using technology to solve real-world problems. Our lab consists of two main teams:

- DVA LAB (Service Team)
- DVA LAB (AI Model Development Team)

## 📅 Current Progress
- Completed MVP development (both front-end and back-end).
- Finalized service planning and built datasets for AI training.
- Developed AI models (detection, tracking, anomaly detection) and service APIs, with ongoing efforts to improve accuracy.

## 🤝 Join Us!
We are looking for individuals who are passionate about AI, technology, and marine conservation. Whether you’re experienced in model compression, ML service development, or AI model optimization, we would love to have you contribute to our mission!
